Snakemake workflow used to deploy and perform basic indexes of genome sequence.

This is done for teaching purpose as an example of FAIR principles applied with
Snakemake.

## Usage

The usage of this workflow is described in the [Snakemake workflow catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog?usage=tdayris/fair_genome_indexer), it is also available [locally](https://github.com/tdayris/fair_genome_indexer/blob/main/workflow/reports/usage.rst) on a single page.

## Results

The expected results of this pipeline are described [here](https://github.com/tdayris/fair_genome_indexer/blob/main/workflow/reports/results.rst). An example of report can be found in [.test](https://github.com/tdayris/fair_genome_indexer/blob/main/.test/report.html) directory.
